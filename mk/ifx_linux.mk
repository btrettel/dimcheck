# TODO: Ask question about `do concurrent` on Intel Fortran forum. What's the right compiler flag? `-parallel` isn't for ifx contrary to what was said there. Update this afterward.

# Removed: `-diag-error-limit=1`

# `-xHost`: <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/fortran-compiler/developer-guide-reference/2024-2/xhost-qxhost.html>

# `-standard-semantics` is only used for BUILD=debug due to a potential performance reduction.
# <https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/868#issuecomment-1720960031>

# `-diag-disable=10440`: This is to avoid a warning about debug mode disabling optimizations. This warning might only appear on older versions of ifx.

# `-nostandard-realloc-lhs`: This could be useful to catch undesired reallocation on assignment. Memory allocation could be slow.
