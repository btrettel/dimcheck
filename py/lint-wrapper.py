#rule_ids_to_ignore = set()
# COM.PRES.Indent: I don't indent in their expected style.
# COM.PRES.LengthLine: My maximum line length is 132, not 100.
# COM.INST.CodeComment: Commented out code can be useful sometimes.
# COM.DATA.NotUsed: The compilers seem to do a better check on these with no false positives.
# COM.FLOW.Abort: The `stop` procedure is useful.
# COM.DATA.Invariant: Too many false positives.
# COM.DATA.Initialisation: Too many false positives. ("The variable parameter is used before being initialized". No, the variable name is not parameter!)
# F90.REF.Interface: Too many false positives.
# F90.DATA.Float: Too many false positives.
# F90.DATA.Declaration: The compilers seem to do a better check on these with no false positives.
# COM.INST.Brace: Not sure how to satisfy this one.
# COM.FLOW.FileExistence: False positive when this is done with a procedure.
# F90.INST.Only: Why have this?
# F90.DESIGN.IO: Too many false positives.
# COM.PROJECT.Header: You need to add comments precisely how they expect it, which is quite brittle. Too many false positives.
# F90.DESIGN.Interface: It's not clear to me why this warning is appearing. Could be due to using derived types.
# COM.FLOW.CheckCodeReturn: False positives on derived type constructors.
# F90.NAME.KeyWords: Too many false positives.
# F90.TYPE.Integer: Too many false positives.
# COM.FLOW.ExitLoop: There are reasons to have more than one exit per loop.
# COM.FLOW.CheckUser: I have no idea what this is supposed to catch.
# F90.REF.Open, F90.ERR.OpenRead, F90.ERR.Allocate: I decided to not use `iostat`/`stat` in `open`, `allocate`, etc., if I simply want the compiler to terminate the program at that point.
# COM.DESIGN.Alloc: This can't be satisfied for my operators in autodiff.f90.
# F90.INST.Nullify: This leads to false positives for allocated pointer arrays.
# COM.FLOW.Exit: Too many false positives.
# F90.REF.Label: False positives for `end where`, and false positives in general.
# COM.TYPE.Expression: Too many false positives.
# F90.DATA.Constant: I don't care about this one.
# COM.NAME.Homonymy: Too many false positives.
# F90.BLOC.File: Disabled as I often close units in different scopes.
# COM.FLOW.FilePath: I don't care about this one.
# F90.DATA.ConstantFloat: False positives on arrays.
# F90.INST.Intent: False positives for automatic arrays.
# COM.DATA.FloatCompare: False positives...
# F90.DESIGN.Include: I think that `include` is okay.
